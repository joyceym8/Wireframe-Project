# Wireframe-Project

## Welcome to the project Github.  

In case you don't know, Github is one of many different platforms that programmers use for version control. Its main use is keeping track of changes done on a project. Besides that, it also keeps track of what changes have been made and who made them. I know it may seem a bit complicated at first, but I'm sure you'll all find it extremely helpful to learn, especially considering the fact that you will undoubtedly be forced to learn it in a later class.

## So what now?

The first part is easy, you create a Github account.  The next step is to install [git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) on your system.  Once you have git installed on your system, you can either use the command line or a GUI.  It's okay to use a GUI at first, but you may want to look into learning the command line so that you can have more control over a project's files.

If you want to use a gui, you can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), it's made by the same people that made github and is built on [electron](https://electronjs.org/), a really cool technology for making apps with web code.  Besides that, I've heard __really__ good things about a program called [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

## Got it, now what?

You need to install a proper [text editor/ IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).  This is another area where there are way too many options.  I personally use [Atom](https://atom.io/), it is cross platform, very extendable, and has git support built in!  

Besides Atom, [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) released [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) a few years aMgo and apparently it is really bad ass.  The only  downside to it is that it's only for web development whereas Atom can be extended to handle just about anything.

Anyways, try them out, try others, see what fits you.  If you do decide to try Atom, here's some extensions that I wouldn't want to live without:

__Emmet__ | [Makes writing websites a breeze.  It uses a syntax similar to css to automate repetitive tasks.](https://scotch.io/tutorials/write-html-crazy-fast-with-emmet-an-interactive-guide)
-|-
__Beautify__ | Takes the most mangled code and fixes it to be more readable.  There are many beautifiers out there, but this one works on a lot of different languages.
__Markdown Preview__ | Github created a shorthand way of creating documents that can be exported to HTML and PDF formats very easily.  It is used by a lot of bloggers and site designers to make quick content.  As a matter of fact, this readme file is written in Markdown. I use it to take really organized notes really fast. [This](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is the tutorial I used to to learn it, but there are many many more you can find.

## Phew! Now what?

Now that we are up and ready, it's time to create the project. I went ahead and created the basic folder structure for us.  It's basically two mini-projects in one: the website and the app, ~~hence the two main folders~~(the app folder wont sync since it's empty).

You can scroll up and hit the issues button to see the different tasks we need to accomplish.  The only one there now is about the project, so we may discuss what exactly we want to do.  I'll add more to the list after we make a few more decisions.

Anyways, don't worry if this seems like a lot to take in, but these are things you'll need to do at some point anyways. It's a __very__ good idea to knock these out on an easy assignment such as this one, rather than stressing out trying to learn git or choosing an IDE while working on your first difficult project. Any questions from here on out? Shoot me an email and I'll try to help you out. Better yet, make it a group email so that everyone else can learn.
